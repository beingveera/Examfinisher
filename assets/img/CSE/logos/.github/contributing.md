# Contributing

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree with what is specified
under the [license section](https://github.com/abranhe/program-languages-logos).

### General Rules

- As much as possible, try to follow the existing format of markdown & code.
- Folders and images names must be lower case letter.
- Programming language folders and picture name with more than one word: (i.e.
Common Lisp) must be separated by a hyphen or a minus (`-`) like this:

```
src
└── common-lisp
     ├── common-lisp.png
     └── common-lisp.svg
```

### Contributing with a new logo

- Make your pull requests to be **specific** and **focused**. Instead of
contributing "several logos" all at once, contribute them all one by one
separately (i.e. one pull request for "Javascript Logo", another one for
"Rust Logo" and so on).

**Programming languages Logos Structure**

All logos are included in [`/src`][src] directory, inside of it it must have
a folder with the name of the programming language.

- You must provide a `2048x2048` for the default `*.png` image.
- You must provide a `256x256` for the `*.svg` image.

Others? Pull request, and add it!

Just providing the main image all the dimensions are automatically
generated by `generate-images.sh` on the [`/scripts`][scripts] directory.

Before opening a pull request, make sure you generate all dimensions. See
`generate-images.sh` usage:

```sh
# This script automatically generates:
#
#   1) All the different sized versions of a logo
#   2) And, if needed:
#
#       * programming-languages.png
#       * src/programming-languages.gif
#
# Usage: generate-images.sh [dir] [dir] ...
#   e.g: generate-images.sh src/cpp src/java
```

The structure should looks like this!

```
src
├── c
│   ├── c.png
│   └── c.svg
│
└── java
    └── java.png
        ├── java_16x16.png
        ├── java_24x24.png
        └── etc...
```
